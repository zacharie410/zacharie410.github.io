      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm a passionate software engineer and game developer with over a
        decade of experience in the tech industry. I've amassed a diverse set of
        skills through a combination of self-learning, university education, and
        real-world experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        After teaching myself programming, I honed my skills at university and
        college, earning formal qualifications while continuing to learn on my
        own. I'm proficient in several programming languages, including Python,
        JavaScript, C#, Lua, and Java.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience ranges from web development to game programming, video
        game AI, and machine learning. Over the years, I've worked on numerous
        projects, creating everything from dynamic web-like UIs to managing
        Roblox projects, and even delving into the complexities of
        cybersecurity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always eager to take on new challenges and use my skills to make a
        positive impact. I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio, and don't
        hesitate to get in touch if you're interested in collaborating on a
        project.
